# UChicago_MA_Thesis_Experiment
This repository stores the JsPsych code for setting up the experiment for my MA thesis at UChicago.

## To-do
1. Update the init_display method in sketchpad signature to draw incomplete shapes (instead of a background image).
2. Find out how to convert an image (i.e., incomplete shape) to x-y coordinates.
